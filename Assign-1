Q1. (i) Find the approximate time your computer takes for a single addition by adding first 106 positive integers using a for loop and dividing the time taken by 106 Similarly find the approximate time taken for a single multiplication and division. Report the result obtained in the form of a table.
Sol: 

#For Addition

import time

# starting time
start = time.time()
n = input("Enter Number to calculate sum ")
n = int (n)
sum = 0
for num in range(0, n+1, 1):
    sum = sum+num
print("SUM of first ", n, "numbers is: ", sum )
# end time
end = time.time()

# total time taken
print(f"Runtime of the program is for addition is {end - start} seconds")

#For Product

import time

# starting time
start = time.time()
product = 1
for n in range(1, 1000001):
    product = product*n
end = time.time()
time_taken=(end-start)/1000000
# total time taken
print(time_taken)

#For Division
div=1
start = time.time()
for v in range(1, 1000001):
  div=div/v
end=time.time()
time_taken=(end-start)/1000000
print(time_taken)
